    <h1>Chicken Adobo</h1>
    <img src="img/adobo.jpg" alt="chicken adobo" width="350">
    <p>Chicken adobo is a classic dish in the cuisine of the Philippines,
    one that predates any external influence.</p>
    <p>This version is based on a more modern iteration, using soy sauce to provide savory depth and rice vinegar
    for adobo's signature acidity.</p>
    <p>Browning the meat, while optional, improves the depth of flavor in both the chicken</p> 
    <p>and the sauce, and you can take that even further by broiling the braised chicken after it's fully cooked.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, quartered and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown on both sides, then remove.</li>
        <li>Stir in the onion and garlic; cook until they soften and brown, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in vinegar and soy sauce, and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf. Add the browned chicken, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
